# DYNAMIC_IBD-ABX

We estimated the abundance of the antibiotics resistance genes from the shotgun metagenomics data fro DYNAMIC study using [ShortBRED](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/shortbred). The ShortBRED results were generated using [Sunbeam](https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sunbeam) extension [sbx_shortbred](https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sbx_shortbred). Here we focued on parsing the results in R.

We started with showing how to mining the [CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/) database, and listing out four published studies about mining the abx-resistance genes from shotgun data in **liberature_review.pdf**.
